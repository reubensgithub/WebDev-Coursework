## Description

The program I have created is a full-stack Tetris game, which has a login page.
If the user does not have an account, they can click a hyperlink which will redirect 
the user to a registration page. Once the user is logged in, they can play the tetris game or view 
the leaderboard.


## Getting started:

To get started, you'll need to meet the following pre-requisites:
- A full LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack installed.

## How to Use

To start the application, open https://labs.azure.com/virtualmachines and sign in to your
account. Then, start the virtual machine. Once it has started up,
open the link which should look something like this:
ml-lab-...-ukwest.cloudapp.azure.com:your-port
(mine is ml-lab-4d78f073-aa49-4f0e-bce2-31e5254052c7.ukwest.cloudapp.azure.com:64743 )\
